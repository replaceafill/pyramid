Next release
============

Bug Fixes
---------

- Forward port from 1.3 branch: When no authentication policy was configured,
  a call to ``pyramid.security.effective_principals`` would unconditionally
  return the empty list.  This was incorrect, it should have unconditionally
  returned ``[Everyone]``, and now does.

Features
--------

- Custom objects can be made easily JSON-serializable in Pyramid by defining
  a ``__json__`` method on the object's class. This method should return
  values natively serializable by ``json.dumps`` (such as ints, lists,
  dictionaries, strings, and so forth).

- The JSON renderer now allows for the definition of custom type adapters to
  convert unknown objects to JSON serializations.

- As of this release, the ``request_method`` predicate, when used, will also
  imply that ``HEAD`` is implied when you use ``GET``.  For example, using
  ``@view_config(request_method='GET')`` is equivalent to using
  ``@view_config(request_method=('GET', 'HEAD'))``.  Using
  ``@view_config(request_method=('GET', 'POST')`` is equivalent to using
  ``@view_config(request_method=('GET', 'HEAD', 'POST')``.  This is because
  HEAD is a variant of GET that omits the body, and WebOb has special support
  to return an empty body when a HEAD is used.

- ``config.set_request_property`` now causes less code to be executed at
  request construction time.

- Don't add a ``?`` to URLs generated by request.resource_url if the
  ``query`` argument is provided but empty.

- Don't add a ``?`` to URLs generated by request.route_url if the
  ``_query`` argument is provided but empty.

- The static view machinery now raises (rather than returns) ``HTTPNotFound``
  and ``HTTPMovedPermanently`` exceptions, so these can be caught by the
  NotFound view (and other exception views).
